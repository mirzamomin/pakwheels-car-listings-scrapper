# 🚗 PakWheels Car Scraper

A Python script that scrapes **used car listings** from [PakWheels.com](https://www.pakwheels.com) using **Selenium**.
It extracts metadata (price, mileage, brand, transmission, engine, etc.), downloads listing images, and saves everything in a **CSV + ZIP archive**.

---

* 📊 Collects data like:

  * Brand & Model
  * Year
  * Transmission
  * Fuel type
  * Mileage
  * Price (in PKR)
* 🖼️ Downloads **all listing images** into organized folders.
* 📑 Exports results into a **CSV file**.
* 📦 Zips CSV + images into one archive for easy sharing.
* 📈 Computes **average price** and **average mileage** of the scraped cars.

---

## ⚡ Requirements

* Python **3.8+**
* Google Chrome & matching [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

---

## 📂 Output

1. Creates a folder named `<car_name>+<year>` containing:

   * **CSV file** with structured listings.
   * **Images folder** with all car photos organized by listing ID.
2. Zips the entire folder into `<car_name>+<year>.zip`.
3. Deletes the temporary unzipped folder automatically.

## 📊 Example Output

```bash
✅ Saved 12 ads to wagon+r+2018.csv
🚗 Car Name: Wagon R VXL
Average price: 2,270,000 PKR
Average mileage: 147,000 KMs
```

CSV file (`wagon+r+2018.csv`) example:

Would you like me to also generate a **ready-to-use `requirements.txt` file** alongside this README so you can directly push both to GitHub?
